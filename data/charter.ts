**IMPORTANT CHARTER AGREEMENT TERMS & DISCLAIMER**

**Pricing & Availability**
All charter pricing is estimated and subject to final confirmation based on real-time aircraft availability, fuel costs, airport fees, and routing requirements. The prices displayed are base charter costs and do not include additional fees such as international handling charges, landing fees, overnight crew expenses, catering, ground transportation, or de-icing (where applicable). A formal quote will be provided before contract execution.

**Aircraft Availability**
While we make every effort to provide the aircraft type you select, operational circumstances may require substitution with a comparable or superior aircraft. All substitutions maintain equivalent or better safety standards, seating capacity, and amenities. PexJet reserves the right to assign aircraft based on availability and operational efficiency.

**Flight Operations & Safety**
All flights are conducted in accordance with local and international aviation regulations. Flight schedules are subject to air traffic control clearances, weather conditions, crew duty time limitations, and technical airworthiness requirements. The Pilot-in-Command has final authority regarding flight safety and may delay, divert, or cancel flights if conditions are deemed unsafe.

**Weather & Force Majeure**
PexJet is not liable for delays, cancellations, or itinerary changes caused by weather, air traffic control restrictions, runway closures, natural disasters, political unrest, or other events beyond our control. While we will make reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions, safety takes absolute precedence.

**Passenger Responsibilities**
Passengers must possess valid travel documents (passports, visas, health certificates) for all destinations. PexJet is not responsible for denied entry or deportation due to improper documentation. All passengers must comply with customs and immigration regulations. Prohibited items and dangerous goods are strictly forbidden.

**Payment Terms**
Charter services require payment in accordance with the terms specified in your contract. Typical terms include a deposit upon booking and full payment 72 hours before departure. Cancellation fees apply as outlined in the charter agreement.

**Liability Limitations**
PexJet's liability is limited to the terms specified in the charter contract and applicable aviation insurance policies. We strongly recommend passengers obtain comprehensive travel insurance covering trip cancellation, medical emergencies, and personal belongings.

**Contact Method**
Your preferred contact method (WhatsApp, Email, or Phone) will be used for all communications regarding your charter. Please ensure the contact information provided is accurate and monitored regularly. Time-sensitive information will be communicated through your preferred channel.

By submitting this charter request, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms and conditions. A formal charter contract will be provided for your review and signature before flight operations commence.

export const charterFAQ = [
  {
    question: "How does private jet chartering work?",
    answer:
      "Simply submit your flight details through our form, select from available aircraft options, and our team will coordinate all aspects of your journey including crew, catering, ground transportation, and any special requests. We handle everything from takeoff to landing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What determines charter pricing?",
    answer:
      "Charter pricing is based on several factors including aircraft type, flight distance, flight time, airport fees, crew costs, fuel prices, and any additional services requested. We provide transparent pricing with no hidden fees, and you'll receive a detailed quote before confirming your charter.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the luggage rules?",
    answer:
      "Luggage capacity varies by aircraft. Generally, light jets accommodate 4-6 bags, mid-size jets 6-10 bags, and heavy jets 10-14 bags. We accommodate special items like golf clubs, skis, or oversized luggage with advance notice. There are no strict weight limits like commercial airlines.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are flight times estimated?",
    answer:
      "Flight times are calculated based on aircraft cruising speed, route distance, prevailing winds, and required air traffic routing. Our estimates include taxi time but may vary by ±15-20 minutes depending on weather and air traffic conditions. We always provide real-time updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the passenger limits?",
    answer:
      "Each aircraft has specific passenger capacity ranging from 4 seats in very light jets to 16+ in ultra-long-range aircraft. The listed capacity is the maximum, but fewer passengers often means more space and comfort. We can recommend the optimal aircraft for your group size.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book multi-leg charters?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Multi-leg charters are ideal for business trips with multiple destinations or complex itineraries. You can visit several cities in one trip with the aircraft waiting for you at each location. This is often more economical than booking separate one-way flights.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book?",
    answer:
      "While we can accommodate last-minute requests (even same-day), we recommend booking at least 4-6 hours in advance for domestic flights and 12-24 hours for international flights to ensure aircraft availability and proper flight planning.",
  },
  {
    question: "What airports can you fly to?",
    answer:
      "We have access to over 5,000 airports worldwide, including small regional airports and private FBOs (Fixed Base Operators) that commercial airlines cannot reach. This flexibility allows you to land closer to your final destination, saving valuable ground travel time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are pets allowed on charter flights?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Unlike commercial airlines, your pets can fly comfortably in the cabin with you. We welcome all pets and can arrange special accommodations. Please inform us in advance so we can prepare the aircraft accordingly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if weather affects my flight?",
    answer:
      "Safety is our top priority. If weather conditions are unsafe, our experienced pilots and operations team will recommend alternative routing, delays, or rescheduling. We monitor weather continuously and provide real-time updates. Charter flexibility allows us to adjust departure times to avoid weather systems.",
  },
